= SonarQube plugins

Creedengo's first implementation is as SonarQube plugins, which can be used to detect code smells through SonarQube's static analysis of your code.

Creedengo provides two kinds of plugins:

* *Plugins for web/back-office (Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python)*.
They use code smells described in the 2nd edition of the repository, published in September{nbsp}2015.
You can find all the rules https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nujR4EnajnR0NSXjvBW3GytOopDyTfvl3eTk2XGLh5Y/edit#gid=1386834576[here] (in French).
The repository for web/back-office rules is link:{gci-github-organization}/creedengo-rules-specifications[green-code-initiative/creedengo-rules-specifications].

* *Plugins for mobile (Android/iOS)*, using https://github.com/cnumr/best-practices-mobile[a set of code smells] theorised
by Dr. Olivier Le Goa√´r.
You can find this plugin in the repository link:{gci-github-organization}/ecoCode-android[green-code-initiative/ecoCode-android].

== How a SonarQube plugin works

Code is parsed to be transformed as an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
The AST allows the scanner to access one or more nodes in the analyzed code.
For example, it is then possible to access all `for` loops, to explore content etc.
The plugin defines rules and checks whether the parsed AST is compliant.

When it is not, an issue is raised and made available in SonarQube's UI.

To better understand AST structure, you can use the https://astexplorer.net/[AST Explorer].

== Supported languages

Creedengo supports 7 technologies right now:

* "Standard" plugins:
** xref:creedengo-java::index.adoc[]
** link:{gci-github-organization}/creedengo-javascript[JavaScript plugin] (‚ö†Ô∏è integration in documentation pending)
** link:{gci-github-organization}/creedengo-php[PHP plugin] (‚ö†Ô∏è integration in documentation pending)
** link:{gci-github-organization}/creedengo-python[Python plugin] (‚ö†Ô∏è integration in documentation pending)
** link:{gci-github-organization}/creedengo-csharp[C# plugin] (‚ö†Ô∏è integration in documentation pending)

* Mobile plugins:
** link:{gci-github-organization}/ecoCode-android[Android plugin] (‚ö†Ô∏è integration in documentation pending)
** link:{gci-github-organization}/creedengo-ios[iOS plugin] (‚ö†Ô∏è integration in documentation pending)

== üõí Distribution

The primary way to obtain Creedengo plugins is through the SonarQube Marketplace, accessible in the Administration  section.
Alternatively, you can download them directly from the GitHub releases.

[NOTE]
The (then-"ecoCode") plugins were previously hosted on a single repository.
We split it to one repository per plugin in December{nbsp}2023.
Thus, the plugin should be retrieved from a repository or another depending on the wanted version.

* Java plugin:
** from 0.x to 1.4.3: link:{gci-github-organization}/creedengo-rules-specifications/releases[creedengo repository]
** since 1.5.0: link:{gci-github-organization}/creedengo-java/releases[creedengo-java repository]
* PHP plugin:
** from 0.x to 1.3.1: link:{gci-github-organization}/creedengo-rules-specifications/releases[creedengo repository]
