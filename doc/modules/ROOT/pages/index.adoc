== About

Creedengo is a collective project aiming to reduce environmental footprint of software at the code level.
The goal of the project is to provide a list of static code analyzers to highlight code structures that may have a negative
ecological impact: energy and resources over-consumption, "fatware," shortening terminals' lifespan, etc.

// FIXME add link to rules doc
Creedengo is based on evolving catalogs of good practices, for various technologies.
A SonarQube plugin hen implements these catalogs as rules to scan your projects.

[WARNING]
This is still a very early-stage project.
Any feedback or contribution will be highly appreciated.
Please refer to xref:contributing.adoc[].
