= Rules Tagging system and Creating Quality Profile

== Purpose

=== Rules Tagging system

Add one new tag to a list of rules from `SONAR_RULES_REUSED.md` (using SonarQube API).

Why? Because maybe some original SonarQube rules are already ready for being part of this plugin.

=== Creedengo Quality Profile

Add one new Profile by language inherited from SonarWay (using SonarQube API).

Why ?

* We must create a custom Profile to use new eco-design rules from Creedengo plugins.
* The new profile is inherited from SonarWay to keep natives SonarWay rules also.
The script attaches the new rules with the new quality profile.
The new profile becomes the default profile for the language.

== Requirements

* SonarQube installed
** Got *'Admininister: Quality Profiles'* global permission on your account

== Setup

=== SonarQube

. Add a new token in personal account settings to communicate with Sonar API ("user token" type)

. Check `_config.sh` file:
+
[options="header",cols="~h,~m,~"]
|===
|Setting |Variable |Values
|Debug mode |DEBUG |`0` to disable, `1` to enable
|Simulation mode |SIMULATION |`0` to disable, `1` to enable
|Sonar token |SONAR_TOKEN |the token generated in the previous step
|Sonar URL |SONAR_URL |the URL to your SonarQube instance (default: `http://localhost:9000`)
|Name of the tag to add |TAG_ECODESIGN |the name of the new tag to add to a list of rules
|File path to `SONAR_RULES_REUSED.md` |FILEPATH_SONAR_RULES_REUSED |filepath in the local folder, contains all rules
|Name of the profile to add |PROFILE_ECODESIGN |the name of the new profile to add for each language
|Language keys list |PROFILE_LANGUAGE_KEYS |the list of all languages to add the new Creedengo quality profile to (string format, separated with one comma)
|Profiles set as default |IS_PROFILE_ECODESIGN_DEFAULT |`1` for the newly created profiles to be set as default for each language, `0` to not change the default profiles
|===

== Local development environment

Different environments have been used:

* bash 3.2 on macOS with extra `jq` package (`brew install jq`)
* Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS (bash 5.0.17(1)-release) with extra `jq` package (`sudo apt install jq`)

== Concepts

=== Call Sonar API rest to

==== Tags

- ... get rule data (included systags array and tags array)
- ... update rule data i.e tags array

==== Quality Profile

- ... create custom quality profile
- ... change parent profile
- ... get profile key
- ... activate existing rules associated with mentioned tag

=== Tags modifications

SonarQube's `systags` are not editable from API (it seems to be natively fulfilled with SonarQube installation).
Tags array seems to be the editable part.
It's editable from:

* SonarQube's UI;
* SonarQube's API.

== Algorithm

=== Tagging scripts

* get rules data (rules list from parsing `SONAR_RULES_REUSED.md`)
* check if new tag to add (from config file) already exists on systags array or tags array
* add new tag to all existing tags if necessary

.Files
* `check_tags.sh`: read tags for all listed rules
* `clean_tag.sh`: delete specified tag from all listed rules
* `install_tag.sh`: add specified tag to all listed rules

=== Profile script

* create a custom profile for each language
* change parent profiles with "Sonar Way"
* activate existing rules tag by `TAG_ECODESIGN` variable to the custom profile

.Files
- `install_profile.sh`: create new custom profile

== How does it work?

* change configuration in `_config.sh` file: check requirements above
* launch `check_tags.sh` to control your rules and tags
* launch `install_tags.sh` to add custom tag to your rules
* launch `check_tags.sh` again to control your rules and tags
* launch `install_profile.sh` to create profiles with the new rules from plugins

== Contributing

**You want to add new pre-existing rule from Sonar?**

You have to:
. find the sonar key from **"RULES"** view on Sonarqube;
. adding a new line to `SONAR_RULES_REUSED.md` with this key;
. add references to justify this value;
. create a Pull Request following `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
